# Arduino-LDR-Application

## Description
This project utilizes the Arduino ESP32 Espressif to create a light-sensing IoT device to automatically upload sensor readings to an app. 

## Prerequisites
### Hardware
For this project, it is necessary to acquire a microcontroller which is programmable by the Arduino IDE and compatible with the ESP32 Espressif and wifi.

The device presented in this project is the [Adafruit HUZZAH32 - ESP32 Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/overview).

A photoresistor is used in this example, but other sensors like a phototransistor or photodiode can be used depending on light reading requirements.

A resistor between 1000 Ohms and 10,000 Ohms is recommended for the voltage divider circuit. 

Our Parts List
